# PacMen
Description: This includes pacmen generation at random locations on the screen and they travel at random speeds. These first move from left to right and top to bottom. Once they hit the screen boundary they change direction and repeat the movements. 

How to Run: To run this project, open the index.html file in any browser and refresh.

Next Steps: I plan to play with changing the color of the images and also the background colors along with the size of the images.
