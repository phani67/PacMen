# PacMen
Description: This includes pacmen generation at random locations on the screen and they travel at random speeds. User can select any number of pacmen on the screen. Once the "Start Game" is clicked, the pacmen move on the screen. These first move from left to right and top to bottom. Once they hit the screen boundary they change direction and repeat the movements. As they move, the pacmen open and close their mouths at regular intervals. When moving from left to right the face of the pacmen is to the right, and as the movement is from right to left, the face of the pacmen is to the left.

How to Run: To run this project, open the index.html file in any browser and refresh.

Next Steps: I plan to play with changing the color of the images and also the background colors along with the size of the images. At this point, the face either turns right or left. I would like to figure out a way to change the face direction based on the angle of impact to the screen boundary.
